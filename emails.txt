Subject: Error in installing v3.6

Dear all,

I encountered some problem trying to install v3.6 on my PC. Could someone
please point out how to fix it? Do I need to remove v3.5 first or it is
because of something else?

Thanks,

Michael

Extract the complete folder from the downloaded package, and replace all
existing files. If not sure, remove the existing q directory and get a new
copy from the downloaded ZIP file.

Subject: sql server database to kdb+ database

Hi everyone,

I'm new to kdb+. What I have now is huge amount of intraday equity data
stored in sql server database, and I would like to store them in kdb+
dababase format. I learned that the best way to do it is through
partitioned tables with date or trading code as my partition domain.

My question is that is it really necessary to convert from sql server
format to kdb+ format? And if so, is it simple like "query from sql server
and save the fields into different columns" or do I get something wrong?

Thanks in advance,

Michael

Looks like you'll have some study to catch up first. You've got to
understand the basic conceptual differences between a traditional RDBMS and
kdb+ in order to effectively work out the work flow you need.

The short answer is: From kdb+, you can indeed run sql queries on you
existing data in order to extract data into kdb+ for further processing.
But in order to make full use of kdb+'s power, you'd have to make use of a
database in kdb+'s native format.

Recommended starters:

   - https://code.kx.com/q/cookbook/splayed-tables/
   - To export from SQL to large CSVs and import into q:

      - Or, to query SQL from within q:

To: personal-kdbplus@googlegroups.com

A few things could have caused the hopen to hang:

1. you were running a query that caused the instance to be busy (hopen has
to wait until your query finishes)

2. you were working in debug mode on the instance. The instance will not
accept hopens or queries until you exit debug mode.

3. You altered .z.pw or .z.po

As for how you could try to catch this issue in future - modify .z.pw and
.z.po to capture/log the incoming hopen request.

Subject: timestamp of max and min value when using xbar for OHLC?



Hi,


I'm looking for an efficient way to easily grab the exact timestamps
associated with the highs and the lows within a OHLC (open, high, low,
close) aggregation via xbar


For example:

select open_timestamp: first time, open:first price, high:max price,
low:min price, close:last price, last_timestamp: last time by
0D00:10:00.000000000 xbar time from trade where sym=`XXXXXX


As shown above, it's easy enough to grab the times of the first and
the last values (open_timestamp and last_timestamp), but indexing in and
getting the timestamp for the max and min values is less straight forward
..



I came up with  messy and verbose way to do this, but I=E2=80=99m sure there is a
better way to do this .. via search & comparison (?) or similar which is
eluding me at the moment.



Any ideas?

Thanks,

Bill
